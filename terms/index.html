              <p class="sub-text margin-top-20">
                You agree that all disputes between you and Applova will be
                resolved by binding, individual arbitration under the American
                Arbitration Association’s rules for arbitration of
                consumer-related disputes and you and Applova expressly waive
                trial by jury. This dispute resolution provision will be
                governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. In the event the
                American Arbitration Association is unwilling or unable to set a
                hearing date within one hundred and eighty (180) days of filing
                the case, then either Applova or you can elect to have the
                arbitration administered instead by the Judicial Arbitration and
                Mediation Services. Judgment on the award rendered by the
                arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent
                jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding,
                the arbitrator will not have authority to award damages,
                remedies or awards that conflict with this Agreement. If any
                provision of this Agreement is held to be unlawful, void, or for
                any reason unenforceable during arbitration or by a court of
                competent jurisdiction, then that provision will be deemed
                severable from this Agreement and will not affect the validity
                and enforceability of any remaining provisions. Applova’s
                failure to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any
                provision of this Agreement will be deemed a further or
                continuing waiver of such term or condition or any other term or
                condition. Applova reserves the right to change this dispute
                resolution provision, but any such changes will not apply to
                disputes arising before the effective date of the amendment.
