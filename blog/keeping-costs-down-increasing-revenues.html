                With the effects of the pandemic worsening on a daily basis, it
                is quite important that as restaurateurs, you know the best way
                to handle the adverse effects of the virus and how to sustain
                your eatery at the same time. In the restaurant perspective,
                there exists two main problems. Firstly, people have been
                greatly warned and discouraged to not interact with other people
                and to keep social gatherings to a bare minimum unless
                absolutely necessary. Secondly is the lockdowns and closures to
                contain the spread and transmission of the virus. Both these
                aspects make it almost impossible to normally function a
                restaurant mainly because of the absence in customers. A lack of
                customers can prove to be very detrimental to your restaurant
                for the following reasons. You are at a loss or shortage in
                income as well as you still have to pay your staff and face
                other operating expenditure as well. We at Applova have just the
                solution for this problem you are facing. To find the solution
                to offset the increased cost and lowered revenue caused by the
                virus, we believe that the root of the problem must be
                addressed. So again, what exactly is the problem? The problem is
                that customers do not like to go to places with large crowds, do
                not like to spend time in places with large crowds and have
                certain hours of the day with curfew imposed so they cannot step
                outside their homes.
              </p>
              <p class="sub-text">
                So what can you do to solve these problems? We suggest the
                following techniques which can be used to both increase revenue
                as well as bring down costs during this period of crisis which
                let’s face it, is an essential thing to be able to do right now.

              <p class="sub-text mt-5">
                To help you understand further, we will briefly describe how
                easily you can integrate each of the following with your
                restaurant operations.
              </p>

              <h3 class="bold-font mt-5">
                1. Consider a mobile order ahead app
              </h3>

              <p class="sub-text">
                So what exactly is a mobile order ahead app? In the simplest of
                terms, a mobile order head app is a convenient and remote
                ordering method you can provide your customers to order their
                favorite dishes from wherever they are. Be it the comfort of
                their own home, office, car or even outside your restaurant
                itself, all your customer needs to do is to place an order via
                their mobile phone and opt to pay either on pickup or
                immediately online when placing their order. This helps you in
                three ways, firstly, it will be quite appealing to customers as
                they do not have to visit your restaurant, wait in line, come
                across many people and worry about getting sick. Additionally,
                you are naturally able to bring down restaurant operating
                expenses as well due to the lack of customers physically inside
                your restaurant. That is, costs like aircon, POS running costs
                and so on. Your customers will only have to walk inside your
                restaurant to pick up their order which is much more likely to
                interest them than having to stay in line and order. Lastly,
                this can also work as a dynamic marketing tool for your
                restaurant as you are now able to reach a larger customer base
                with this remote ordering option.
              </p>

              <h3 class="bold-font mt-5">2. Consider online ordering</h3>

              <p class="sub-text">
                Another convenient and nifty tool you can provide your customers
                is the option to order their food online via your webpage.
                Again, similar to the mobile order ahead app, this provides your
                customers a convenient way to order their food remotely without
                having to physically walk in, stand in line and order their
                food. Similar to the order ahead app, this method will help you
                interest your customers with the convenience it provides them
                amidst this pandemic, it will also help you bring down
                restaurant operating expenses as well as works as a great
                marketing tool for your restaurant. To make things even more
                appealing to customers, you can provide special offers to
                customers when they order online. Couple this with its
                convenience, Couple this with its convenience, this could be a
                great tool for you to increase customer loyalty.
              </p>

              <h3 class="bold-font mt-5">3. Consider curb side ordering</h3>

              <p class="sub-text">
                Curb side ordering is a novel concept but is gaining increasing
                popularity due to its convenient nature to its users. Curb side
                ordering is yet another very convenient method of ordering which
                you can provide your customers. How it works is, you simply give
                your customers the option of curb side pick up in your mobile
                order ahead app or in your online ordering process and all
                customers have to do is pay online and park outside your
                restaurant in a designated parking spot to which one of your
                staff members will hand deliver the food. This way, the customer
                has absolutely no interaction with anyone other than your staff
                member and they can simply drive off without any hassle at all.
                This also takes away the needs to function all equipment at your
                restaurant at 100% capacity as this does not require customers
                to physically step inside your restaurant, thereby bringing down
                operating expenditure.

                We believe that during such adverse periods of time, it is
