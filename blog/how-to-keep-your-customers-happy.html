                Walt Disney had a great outlook on his customers. He said, “Do
                what you do so well that they will want to see it again and
                bring their friends.”
              </p>
              <p class="sub-text">
                Whatever line of business you are in, it is essential that your
                customers are happy. Without a good number of diners, your
                restaurant will find it difficult to keep functioning. This has
                therefore led to fierce competition among restaurants.
              </p>
              <p class="sub-text">
                This massive competition is because there are so many
                restaurants and customers have such a wide choice that the
                ability to stand out and attract diners is very important. One
                way to stand out is customer satisfaction. Customer satisfaction
                is important is because of retention and satisfied customers are
                more likely to return to your restaurant.
              </p>
              <p class="sub-text">
                As a restaurateur you must always bear in mind that retaining
                diners is as important as getting new diners to walk in.
                According to research, it is 6 to 7 times more expensive getting
                new customers than it is to retain an existing one.
                Additionally, diners who come back are likely to spend 25% more
                than new walk-ins, which of course boosts your profits as a mere
                increase of 5% in retention rate will likely boost your profits
                by up to 95%. Another key aspect of customer satisfaction is
                that happy customers give referrals.
              </p>
              <p class="sub-text">
                So now why don’t we address the golden question: How do I keep
                my customers happy?
              </p>
              <p class="sub-text">
                Here are 4 tips on how you make your customers visit your
                restaurant very frequently.
              </p>

              <h3 class="bold-font mt-5">
                1. Get your employees to practice excellent customer service
              </h3>

              <p class="sub-text">
                If you aren’t already paying attention to the quality of your
                customer service and allocating necessary resources to
                frequently train your staff, it is high time to make this an
                urgency. Studies have found that up to 89% of customers stop
                making purchases from a company after experiencing poor customer
                service. It has even been stated that your customer service is
                more important than the quality of your restaurant’s food. The
                truth is a diner wouldn’t like to come back to your restaurant
                if they are treated poorly. A question that keeps a lot of
                restaurateurs thinking is: Does great customer service begin
                with your table staff?
              </p>

              <p class="sub-text">
                The answer is No. Good customer service commences the moment
                diners walk into your restaurant and concludes then moment the
                diners have exited the restaurant. Yes, it does sound like a lot
                of work, but trust us, it is one of, if not, the most important
                attributes of your restaurant. You will be able to please
                customer when your staff is super friendly and are always
                willing to go the extra mile to make the customers have a great
                experience at your restaurant. Employees who are happy with
                their job and work environment naturally try to provide a better
                experience to the diners. Hence, it is important that your staff
                are content with what they are doing. A few techniques you can
                use to train your staff are:
              </p>

              <ul class="page-section__option-list">
                <li>
                  Ask your staff to always converse with respect and use titles
                  to address diners.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Kindly ask your staff to be patient while taking customer
                  orders.
                </li>
                <li>Request your staff to always smile.</li>
                <li>
                  Fine tune their listening skills so that they do not make
                  errors when taking customer orders.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p class="sub-text">
                Your staff play a major role in the success of your restaurant,
                so it is important to make sure that they are providing the best
                of their abilities.
              </p>

              <h3 class="bold-font mt-5">
                2. Provide your diners with rewards
              </h3>

              <p class="sub-text">
                Earning yourself loyal customers is a really beneficial sales
                technique. A good method to earn loyal diners at your restaurant
                is with the use of a loyalty program. Your diners will be very
                pleased when you gift them something in return. A loyalty
                program in that case is a superb way to boost repeat business as
                well as word of mouth referrals. For example, say you own a café
                or a bakery, a great way to give back to your loyal customers
                would be in the form of ‘free croissant with every coffee’ they
                purchase. The use of such a technique will be appealing to many
                customers and will prompt their loyalty to your restaurant.

                If you are unsure or unable to offer such a loyalty program at
                the moment, there are still some other techniques to gift your
                diners and make sure they leave your restaurant cheerier. You
                can surprise regular diners by giving them a free dessert or
                appetizer. It would be even better if the owner or the head chef
                were to hand this out to the diner as it gives them a feeling of
                importance. Additionally, you can also gift your regular diners
                with your restaurant branded merchandize such as mugs, caps or
                pens. It is good to know that people are always happy to be
                pleasantly surprised.

                3. Turn bad experiences around as quickly as possible
              </h3>

              <p class="sub-text">
                A dispute with a diner can be one of the worst problems for a
                restaurant if they aren’t handled smoothly and efficiently. If a
                diner does have a problem, they will leave your restaurant much
                happier if you come up with an adequate solution. Additionally,
                you need to make sure that your staff is properly taught how to
                take care of disputes. When issues related to food or service
                arise, offering something free would go a long way as well. It
                can be in the form of a free meal right away or a gift
                certificate to prompt a revisit. It is very important to deal
                with problems the moment they arise. Never let your customers
                remain in anger while waiting for the problem to be dealt with
                upper level management.

              <p class="sub-text">
                Here are some tips you should remember when a dispute takes
                place:
              </p>
              <p class="sub-text">
                Whenever there is a dispute in the diner, always pay close
                attention to what your diner has to say and refrain from
                interrupting him/her. Ensure that you accept the mistake and let
                the diner know that you are extremely sorry for the
                inconvenience. While the diner is telling you about the issue,
                always remain calm even if you disagree with what the diner
                says. After fully understanding the issue, make an effort to
                negotiate a win-win solution for the diner as well as for you.
                Remember that you should never blame the diner even if he or she
                is at fault. Lastly, it does not cost you a cent to apologize
                once again.

                4. Reduce your customers wait times
              </h3>
              <p class="sub-text">
                Your diners will find it unpleasant to have to wait a long
                period of time for their appetizer, meal or first round of
                drinks. This has a substantial negative impact to your
                restaurant as it has been proven to be very hard to get back a
                customer who is disappointed with your service. Therefore, it is
                crucial that you have enough staff in your kitchen to make sure
                meals are prepared swiftly and enough table staff to quickly
                take your customers orders. If there might be a delay in the
                diners order, politely convey this to your customer in advance.

                As a restaurateur, you are most likely aware of the term ‘speed
                of service’. This is always an important policy to consider in
                your restaurant as it really helps with the ‘great dining
                experience’ you wish to provide to your diners. Your diners most
                likely have anticipations about how long they have to wait to
                get their food. For instance, if your diners want burritos, they
                probably expect you to serve soon, if your diners on the other
                hand wish for steak or wellington, they might be willing to wait
                a bit longer. Your primal objective is to consistently and
                swiftly accommodate all diners at all times of the day.
